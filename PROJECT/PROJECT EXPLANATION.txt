In today's world, the safety of school children during transportation is a 
significant concern for both parents and schools. To address this, we are developing a 
comprehensive school bus safety system that combines advanced health 
monitoring, automated vehicle control, and real-time student tracking. The primary 
goal of the system is to enhance the safety of the bus driver and students, ensuring 
secure transportation .The core of the system is its ability to continuously monitor the 
driver’s heart rate using health sensors. In case of an emergency, such as the driver 
experiencing a high heart rate that could indicate a heart attack, the system takes 
immediate action. First, it sends alerts to the passengers, the bus owner, and 
emergency medical services. This ensures that help is on the way while the situation 
is still developing. Additionally, the bus is programmed to automatically park itself 
in a safe location. This prevents the bus from continuing on the road in an unsafe 
condition, significantly reducing the risk of accidents. 
Beyond driver safety, this system also includes a student tracking feature. Each 
student's entry and exit from the bus is monitored, and automatic messages are sent 
to their parents in real time. This keeps parents informed about when their child 
boards and exits the bus, enhancing the overall safety and transparency of the school 
transportation process. By combining health monitoring, intelligent vehicle control, 
and student tracking, this project aims to make school buses safer and more reliable. 
The system’s dual focus on driver health and student safety provides a 
comprehensive solution to modern challenges in school transportation, offering 
peace of mind to both parents and school authorities. Through the use of embedded 
systems, IoT, and communication technologies, the project ensures a smarter and 
more secure transportation environment .This school bus safety system not only 
protects the driver by monitoring their health but also ensures the safety of the 
students through real-time alerts and automated controls. The system’s dual 
functionality addresses key safety challenges in school transportation, making it a 
valuable contribution to modernizing and securing school buses.
